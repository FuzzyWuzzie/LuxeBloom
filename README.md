# LuxeBloom

A demo for [Luxe](http://luxeengine.com/) showing one way to use shaders and rendertextures to apply a bloom effect to the screen.

>PLEASE NOTE! This demo was created using an ALPHA version of [Luxe](http://luxeengine.com/). As such, it may very well be obsolete by the time you look at it. It is current and working as of `alpha-2.0`, however the API can and likely will change without any hesitation! You've been warned!
